**The problem StegaRust solves**

People can use it to store a password in inconspicuous images.
This allows them to store these images into their own private computers. Thus, there is no need of third party apps to manage your passwords in a cloud or another server ,which could be potentially hacked.
This app can also be used to send secret messages(through images) which can only be read by someone else with the password to read the secret message from the image.
Returning to the inconspicous images, a user can store their password, of their social media account, in a vacation picture. Then use that picture to get the password back.

**How It Works ?**

Step 1: You first upload an image using the "Upload Image" Button.<br>
( The image you upload detemines whether to write a message to it or read a message from it. )<br>
Step 2: Then press the "Write To Image" or "Read From Image" button.


**Writing a secret to an Image ?**

Step 1: Enter the secret message to be written into the file.<br>
Step 2: Enter the password to secure the message into the image.<br>
Step 3: "Write To Image & Download" Button to get the Image.<br>

**Reading a secret from an Image ?**

Step 1: Enter the password to get the message from the image.<br>
Step 2: Press the "Read the Message from the Image" button".<br>
Step 3: The message will be printed besides the "Secret Message: ".<br>
